### Encouraging employees to contribute $2k or $8k to their retirement

-   Here we want to see **the effect of over-asking** on the employees’
    contribution to their retirement.
-   The intervention is to **ask the employees to contribute $2k or
    $8k** to their retirement.

#### Most likely design for the experiment

![](img_1.png)

-   Just like the A/B test done on some websites, we can randomly show
    the employees the none, $2k or $8k contribution option.
- X_1 is the intervention where we ask the employees to contribute $2k to their retirement. 
- X_2 is the intervention where we ask the employees to contribute $8k to their retirement.

**Why we want to prepare the group without $amount specified?** - serves
as a baseline to understand the natural contribution behavior without
any suggested amounts. - we can see the effect of “anchoring” gets
stronger or weaker when we suggest a specific and/or larger amount.

#### Threats to validity

**Internal Validity**

-   if the employees from different groups communicate with each other,
    one could be influenced by the other. For example, if the employees
    from the $2k group talk to the employees from the $8k group, then
    the employees from the $2k group might be influenced by the
    employees from the $8k group and contribute more to their
    retirement.
-   if some employees are aware of the study, they could change their
    behavior.

**External Validity** - it might just be that the employees from this
company have sufficient income to contribute to the effect of
“anchoring”. The effect of intervention could be smaller or larger for
employees from other companies. - if there is an economic event that
affects the employees’ contribution to their retirement, then the result
of the experiment will not be generalizable to other times and
companies.
